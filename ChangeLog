	* PayflowPro.pm: allow configuring the timeout of the request to
	the Payflow servers.  Pass key TIMEOUT to the pfpro() function
	call with a value in seconds for the timeout. Default is 30.
	Patch from Mike Burns <mike.burns@liquidation.com> with minor
	tweaks.

	* PayflowPro.pm: when generating the unique request ID for the
	API, avoid undef warnings when INVNUM is not set (as it is not
	required for referenced credits.)  Fix from bhk@bhent.com.

	* PayflowPro.pm: fixed typo in error message from failure to
